# Vega: A Multi-Age Interactive Exoplanet Exploration Website

**Vega** is an immersive and educational website designed to introduce users of all ages to the fascinating world of **exoplanets**: planets that orbit stars outside our solar system. Exoplanets offer exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth and help answer the fundamental question, "Are we alone in the universe?" This project targets different audiences, including children, high schoolers, and adults, offering tailored content and interactive elements to ensure an engaging learning experience.

For high school students, we offer an engaging eBook that presents information in a clear and easily understandable manner. At the end of the eBook, readers will find an overall comparison featuring data visualizations that highlight the most significant exoplanets, based on key characteristics such as mass, radius, temperature, and distance. At the end there is the predictions of our Machine Learning Model that predicts the habitability for the exoplanets based on NASA’s Exoplanet Archive: Planetary System Composite Data that achieves accuracy 98%.

In addition to the eBook, we provide a **podcast** for those who prefer listening to reading. This way, students can absorb the information in a format that suits them best.

To reinforce learning, we include a short **interactive quiz** at the end of the eBook, allowing users to test their understanding of the material covered. This comprehensive approach ensures that high schoolers gain a solid grasp of exoplanets and their fascinating features.

## Data Sources and Machine Learning Insights

If you're wondering where we sourced the data for our articles aimed at adults and the eBook for high schoolers, we utilized NASA’s **Planetary System Composite Data Set**. This dataset allows us to extract information on exoplanets based on various features, such as the hottest, largest radius, or closest to Earth.

In addition to the dataset, we developed a **machine learning model** to predict habitability based on data clustering, focusing on exoplanets that are closest to Earth. At the end of each article and eBook section dedicated to an exoplanet, we provide our model's prediction regarding its habitability that achieved accuracy 98%, along with a justification of the reasons behind this assessment. This comprehensive approach ensures that readers not only understand the data but also the implications of our findings.
